# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub world!

__Jambo!__ 

I'm Mutava, and I'm super stoked to be a full-stack developer. 

I'm all about bringing ideas to life with clean and efficient code, and I love creating seamless experiences for users through both front-end and back-end wizardry!

__Technologies and Tools__

Here's a sneak peek at the tech I work my magic with:

    Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Typescript, React.js, Vue.js
    Back-end: Node.js, Express.js, Python, Django
    Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL,
    DevOps: Git, Docker, AWS

__Let's Connect!__

I'm all ears (and keyboards) for making new connections. Don't be shy; reach out to me through any of these channels:
